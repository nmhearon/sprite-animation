	<p>The animation turned out pretty great in my opinion, but if I could change just a few things, they would be:</p>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>I would use different techniques to remove the green screen in photoshop</li>
		<li>I would smile in the photos!  I was more focused on making sure I had all the frames I needed, and didn't think about smiling until I started editing.</li>
	</ul>
